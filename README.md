## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned a lot about fonts, as well as how to position a background (qr code background), box-shadow and css customizations.

Some codes:

```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@300;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
#background {
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #BDC6D9;
}
```


### Continued development

I will continue to improve myself in html and css and start bootstrap and javascript.

### Useful resources

- [GitHub](https://www.github.com) - I don't even know what to say about GitHub, because it helps a lot in development, from writing the site to hosting it. I really liked it and will be using it a lot from now on.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This is an amazing site that helped me find fonts of all styles. I highly recommend.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing site that helped me find everything about html and css. I recommend it to anyone who is still learning programming.

## Acknowledgments

I'm new to programming, and finding the frontend mentor was really amazing. This was my first challenge, I did it alone, searching and learning. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I won't give up on this journey.
